🚀 Fuel Prices Reinforcement Learning Environment
This project applies Reinforcement Learning (RL) to model and predict fuel price trends using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithms. The custom RL environment optimizes decision-making in dynamic fuel markets, leveraging advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance predictive accuracy.

📌 Features
🔹 Custom RL Environment: Built using OpenAI Gym, defining action (Buy, Sell, Hold) and reward mechanisms for fuel price optimization.
🔹 Advanced Data Processing: Includes outlier removal, normalization, and feature engineering with price trends, ratios, and cumulative returns.
🔹 Model Training & Optimization: Uses PPO and A2C algorithms with Optuna for hyperparameter tuning and backtesting on unseen data.
🔹 Visualization & Insights: Generates heatmaps, scatter plots, and trend analysis for market behavior understanding.

📊 Outcomes
✔️ Improved fuel price prediction accuracy
✔️ Enhanced decision-making for procurement & pricing strategies
✔️ Potential for real-time market adaptation & automated trading systems

🔮 Future Enhancements
📡 Real-Time Data Integration for live market predictions
📈 Multi-Commodity Expansion (Natural Gas, Electricity)
🧠 Hybrid Modeling (combining RL with LSTM, ARIMA)
🌱 Sustainability Integration (including environmental impact factors)
